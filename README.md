## Project Overview
This project explores the nursing profession and advanced critical care certifications across states in the United States. The dataset includes certifications like CCRN, CMC, CSC, CCRNs (pediatric and neonatal), and PCCN. Alongside, it provides metrics on total RNs, hospitals, and staffed ICU beds by state.
